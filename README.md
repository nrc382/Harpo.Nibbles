# Harpo.Nibbles
JAVA-game inspired by world's famous Nibbles game (also known because nokia's version, Snake)


This is one of my oldest java-projects (ipse est one of my first).
It's completely inefficient: Makes (really) bad use of resources, has really bad code.

Here basically for historical proposes...

By the way any commit would be appreciated. 

(Current version does not work properly)
(Presents a lot of bugs caused by functions-and-properties "toying"...)
(Currently uses non-localized strings: ITALIAN :()
